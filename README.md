#### This project under development!

**Now you can:** 
* register, login and logout from telegram bot
* creat tasks, appoint them to users, update and delete them
* change user's information, update and delete it

**Issues (in development):**
* project isn't deployed - it is local
* you can not see your tasks from bot
* no tests
* shit-code :)
